<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a BSc Computer Science and Mathematics student with a passion for coding
  and problem-solving. When I am not diving into algorithms or software
  development, you can find me immersed in the vibrant world of anime,
  captivated by epic story lines and stunning visuals. I am also a huge football
  fan. My favourite team in South Africa is Orlando Pirates.
